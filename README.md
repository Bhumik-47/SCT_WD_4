# ✅ Task 04: To-Do Web Application

## Project Description

This project is a fully functional To-Do List application, demonstrating core proficiency in modern front-end development through comprehensive DOM manipulation and handling complex user interactions.

## Key Features

* **Full CRUD Functionality:**
    * **Create:** Add new tasks with text and optional due date/time.
    * **Read:** Tasks are listed immediately upon creation.
    * **Update (Edit):** Users can click "Edit" to modify the task text and date simultaneously, with changes saved back to the list item.
    * **Delete:** Tasks can be permanently removed with the "Delete" button.
* **Task Completion:** The "Complete" button toggles a visual state (line-through text and a green border highlight) to distinguish finished tasks.
* **Date & Time Management:** Tasks can be assigned a specific deadline using the native date/time input, which is then displayed in a friendly local format.
